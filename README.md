Pipeline Cost Analysis
1. Bandwidth Cost
The bandwidth cost primarily depends on the amount of data transferred between different components of the pipeline (e.g., data ingestion from external APIs or data movement between storage and compute services). Large datasets or high-frequency API calls increase the cost. 

Mitigation Strategies:
Optimize API usage and reduce unnecessary calls.
Compress data before transfer.
Use cloud regions that minimize data transfer fees.

-----
2. Compute Cost
Compute costs are associated with the processing and transformation of data in the pipeline.

We will be running the Python script and some serverless compute service (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Functions).

High compute-intensive tasks such as machine learning model training or real-time data processing. This data request does not consume much compute cost.

Mitigation Strategies:
Use autoscaling and serverless services to reduce idle time.
Optimize code for efficiency (parallel processing, batching).
Select cost-effective instance types for compute.

-----
3. Database Cost
Database cost depends on the type of database used (e.g., relational vs. NoSQL) and the volume of stored data. Additionally, read/write operations can contribute to the overall cost.

In this case, JSON data can be stored in both relational and nonSQL database, but nonSQL might be more common.

The associated cost drivers include：

Size and frequency of data writes/reads.
Storage requirements (backup and replication).
High-availability configurations and scaling needs.

  Mitigation Strategies:
  Archive old data to cheaper storage solutions.
  Use appropriate indexing and query optimization.
-----

4. Other Storage Cost
Storage costs depend on the amount of data stored, frequency of access, and the type of storage service used. Large volumes of raw and processed data, frequent read/write operations, backup and disaster recovery storage all require a lot of cost.

Mitigation Strategies:
Use lifecycle policies to transition old data to cheaper storage classes.
Store only necessary data—avoid redundant copies.
Compress data to reduce storage size.
